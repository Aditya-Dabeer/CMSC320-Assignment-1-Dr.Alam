Question 1: Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science can be applied to the healthcare field, where it significantly enhances patient care and operational efficiency. For example, by analyzing large datasets of electronic health records, data scientists can identify patterns and predictive factors for diseases such as diabetes or heart disease. This enables early diagnosis and the development of personalized treatment plans tailored to individual patients' needs. Additionally, data science helps in optimizing hospital operations by forecasting patient admissions and managing resources effectively, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.
